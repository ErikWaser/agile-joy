Right now I am sure that the area of unknown, inside me, is much greater than known, when it comes to terms like "agile" or "scrum" what I think is, because of the people I work with and way the course is structured - exciting. I would like to understand the spirit of techniques presented through this course as a part of my being, as - I see them not really as techniques, more like a way of struggling with life, of people that had similar problems that I have and re-think them as my own. My intuitive *way* of working is also the way to understand the others *ways* to work, those who put their names to "Manifesto for Agile Software Development" and others who develop their own *ways*. Tune up, refine, my intuition.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Each teammate has hers, his, own background, what is greatly appreciated. I have a background as an artist, a bit older than my teammates, have kids, a dog, a divorce behind me, I am bit neurotic and volontarily unorganized where it is necessarry. I reflect on everything and have opinion on everything (as every other Croatian) and love people when they dare to talk about things they don't really understand. The best way to help the team is to let others be their unique selves and let the best and finest we have inside start to flow. Yesterday we had a first physical meeting since the start of the pandemics and more than ever I feel the communication as a key to living, loving, learning. I am more than sure that the others feel the same. Let's communicate!

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

It is too early to even try to answer this question.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I think that I was alive and active and tried as much as I could to help with the deliveries when it comes to drawing and minetest building.
