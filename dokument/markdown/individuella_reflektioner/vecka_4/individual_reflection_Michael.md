# Week 4 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I haven’t learnt everything I wanted since last week.  I’ve learnt more about javascript but havent had time to learn about npm /node / express.  So for the next sprint I will be focusing on npm / node / express.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Not much has changed. 

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Participated in the meetings where we discussed what user stories to add.


## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Been working on converting CSV files into a geoJson.and making it appear on the website.
