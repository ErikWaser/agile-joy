# Week 5 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I’ve learnt more about Node.js and Express.js however I still feel I cant contribute much due to my lack of knowledge over D3 API, so we decided not to use the leaflet api. 
For next week:
Get a better understanding of our current code with D3
Learn more about D3. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I still feel that I don’t know enough about the current technologies / apis to help anyone.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
I was the scrum master for this sprint, together with PO (Albin) we added user stories and edited our definition of done.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Because I was the scrum master I haven't contributed much towards the team’s deliveries since most of my time has been spent on improving existing user stories and adding new ones.
