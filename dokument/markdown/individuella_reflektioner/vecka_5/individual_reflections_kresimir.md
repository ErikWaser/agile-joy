# what do I want to learn or understand better?

To work on the project now is much more fun than in the beginning but at the same time it feels like this rainy gray weather makes it especially difficult to develop my part of the project as quickly and efficiently as I would like to. Still, the progress in understanding the D3 library I made this week was very motivating and I continue to use it, as it seems to be a very well written library. I would like to learn D3 better, probably it will be the same wish in the following weeks.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I tried to help the team by sharing the parts of code I was working on, on our communicating platform as some team members are dealing with similar problems as I do.

#what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I tried to bring another, maybe different view on some aspects of the project when discussing it. It is quite obvious to me that a project on a larger scale would need to include as many people as possible with various backgrounds, education, gender, sexual orientation, etc in order to establish an environment where everybody feels welcome and can contribute without feeling, am I allowed to ... , is it acceptable to ... , oh, I screwed it up this time. A homogenous environment such as white-middle class-heterosexual which is quite common in the IT world, sounds quite boring if we think about something like contributing to sustainability as in this course.

#what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I did the part of connecting csv data with geoJSON data, displaying the map and printing the combined data on the screen.
