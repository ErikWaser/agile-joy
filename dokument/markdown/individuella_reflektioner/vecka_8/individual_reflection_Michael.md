# Week 8 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Now when the final sprint is done and I can overlook how the previous sprints went I feel that I learnt a lot about Scrum and agile processes however I feel it's something I can still learn more about. For the future I'd like to use Scrum in my future group projects but also read up more about it to get an even better understanding.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This remains unchanged still. One of the reasons I haven't felt that I could help someone else / team to learn something new is most likely because most of my focus at the beginning went to learning Javascript and working more on the backend which we later moved on from and decided to use D3 instead so I didn't get into D3 until half the sprints were over.  But also because I've only done 1 year of CS studies prior to taking this course.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
For this final sprint its mostly been focusing on finishing the remaining user stories and fixing the bugs, I participated in the meetings but other than that I haven't contributed much.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I didn't contribute anything since most of the user stories we were working on were from last week were mostly done and just needed to be merged together and fixing bugs. This was something that some of the team members were working on.
