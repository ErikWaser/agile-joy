## Week 1

# What do I want to learn or understand better?
For the next sprint I want to polish up my skills on using github because I’ve had very little experience in using it and since we’ll be using github it’d be a good idea to learn more about it. For the coming week I plan to experiment with it to get a better understanding on how to use it.

# How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Currently I'm unsure how I can help the team to learn something new as I feel I'm not at the same level as everyone else, I feel like they know much more than I do. Once we start learning new frameworks etc for the project, then it may become more clear what I can do to help someone / team to learn something new.  

# What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
We haven't begun using Scrum yet, so I'm not sure what to write here. 

# What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Not sure what to write here yet.
