# Week 2 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I mentioned wanting to learn more about github and how to use it for the project. We had a workshop where Albin went through how to use git for the project and how the workflow works, this helped me figure out how to use github. 
I still don’t fully understand what it means to be a scrum master or product owner.  I will go over the past lecture slides to refresh what it means. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I still haven’t figured out how I can help.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
We have yet to start using Scrum.


## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I participated in the meeting where we worked on the project scope.
