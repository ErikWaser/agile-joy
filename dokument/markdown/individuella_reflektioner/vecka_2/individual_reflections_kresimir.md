# what do I want to learn or understand better?

The project is not completely defined.

The scope of the project is largely dependant on our knowledge - the technologies that the project would use.

I would need to understand:

- how to access the public data from SCB, are there some access limits
- how to access OpenStreetMap public data
- how to connect these two
- find a way to visualise the data, is there some specialized FLOSS library focused on data visualisation

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I have been using GNU/Linux for many years, I could help with setting up a server that would run a testing site together with services we would need and learn the others how to quickly do the same.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I am not sure if I could contribute in use of Scrum at this point. It seems that the development of the idea could have been managed better if we used Scrum.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

At this point I tried to be active on the meetings by encouraging the team spirit, listening to others' and contributing with own reflections.
