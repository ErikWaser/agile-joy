# Week 7 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I felt I really started to contribute more. I learnt more about our source code and how D3 works. After this week of being a PO, I still feel that I dont quite fully understand what the role means so for next week i'll reading up more about being a PO means. One of the main reasons I haven't gotten into the role of PO is because we have weekly rotations so I felt I didn't fully grasp what it meant to be in that role.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Throughout most part of the project I feel I haven't known enough about our technologies to be able to teach anyone something new.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
This week I had the honor of being product owner. Because the project is nearing it's end it felt that the best course
would be to finish implementing our current user stories and functionality. So I didn't bring any new ideas of what to implement.
I felt that what we had and what we're doing is good.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week I worked with Kresimir on a function that allows us to show the raw data in a nicely formatted table, we also added
CSS code to make it look nice and a button to make the table appear.
