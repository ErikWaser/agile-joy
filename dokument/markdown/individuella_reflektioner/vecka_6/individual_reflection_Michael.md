# Week 6 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I mentioned that I wanted to learn more about D3 and get a better understanding of  our current code which I feel I have achieved a better understanding of. 

For the next week I want to learn more about CSS and how to implement a table and to show our raw data on the website.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Remains unchanged from last sprints.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
This week I don't feel that I’ve contributed much towards the use of Scrum. 

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I haven't been able to contribute much towards the team’s deliveries since most of my time was spent on understanding D3 and our current code. I will look to contribute more next week. One of the main reasons I haven't been able to contribute more is because I haven’t understood how our code currently works, and that we have certain junk code, for example  files that we don't need which has made it a bit confusing to go through.
