# Week 3 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I've begun learning about javascript and I want to learn more about it. I also wanna learn node.js, express.js and get a better understanding of the leaflet API, since this is stuff we might/ going to  use for the project. 

Last week I mentioned how I didn’t quite understand what a product owner and scrum master means, so I have been going through old slides and also done some research and I feel I got a better understanding of it now.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This is a question I've put a lot of thought into, and I still currently don't know how I can help the team to learn something new. Currently I feel that everyone knows more about the stuff we are doing than me or that we are at the same level which makes it very hard.



## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
So far I haven't contributed much to the use of Scrum.  We started using Scrum this week, so I haven’t had time to contribute towards the usage yet.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
For this sprint I’ve spent more time learning about JavaScript and gotten the right stuff installed, so I haven’t contributed much towards the team’s deliveries this week.
